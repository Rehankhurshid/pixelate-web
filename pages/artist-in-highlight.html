      <div class="case-study--subtitle">The emerging indie scene has uncovered a lot of hidden gems, both in graphic and product design. Artist in Highlight is our weekly design series where we exhibit and interview such home-grown, unconventional designers. We cover an eclectic range of artists and try to touch upon all disciplines of design.  We ask them questions about their creative process and advice they’d give to their younger selves. Through this we hope to give these artists a center stage, that increases the reach of their work and also inspires other upcoming artists.</div>

Though she has always enjoyed it, and has tried her hands at different mediums, the digital one has sort of changed the way she views the possibilities of what she can make, and that’s been a lot of fin to explore over the last few months. She’s actually an educator by profession, and she wants to work her way upto finding a way to effectively incorporate art, education and psychology , something that she can share with other people this makes sense to.
