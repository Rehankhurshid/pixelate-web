      <div class="case-study--body--text">Depending on whom you ask, lo-fi hip-hop is acreative feat of the Internet age, a punchline, or a meaningless label tackedon to souped-up elevator music.The genre started roughly a decade ago among aloose network of artists who repurposed last-century drum machines and samplesfor its signature mellow sound. But in the past few years, lo-fi artist CelínCarlo-Gonzalez said, its audience has changed — from aural tinkerers onSoundCloud to crowds of listeners on YouTube and Spotify seeking unobtrusivemusic for working, studying or doing nothing at all. The tracks blurproductivity and leisure, with labels such as “Beats tochill/study/relax,” and some have become wildlypopular.</div>

      <div class="case-study--body--text">The cover of most lofi hip hop live streams and album covers feature an anime loop, andmost popular among them is the famous lofi studying girl. There has been a lotof discussing on hip hop forums online, about why lofi hip-hop and anime go sowell, maybe it’s merely because of the aesthetics that maybe only an anime canconvey to express the mood of the song, however there are other reasons as welland all of them can be tracked down to one prolific hip hop producer</div>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study--body"><img src="../images/cs-3.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 590px) 88vw, 520px" srcset="../images/cs-3-p-500.png 500w, ../images/cs-3.png 520w" alt="" class="case-study--image">
      <div class="case-study--body--text">The trigger for lofi and anime mixing in was the classic popular anime, samurai champloo.Samurai champloo featured our legend of jazz hop music nujabes. Nujabes was thetrigger of lofi genre. His influence and his art lives on for a long time,eternally goes in loop within the community itself while making new thingsinspired from him</div>

    <div class="case-study--body"><img src="../images/cs-4.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 590px) 88vw, 520px" srcset="../images/cs-4-p-500.png 500w, ../images/cs-4.png 520w" alt="" class="case-study--image">
      <div class="case-study--body--text">After diving deeper you quickly realise that the graphic design community embedded within the lofi culture is rich and diverse. But there are some themes that you encounter again and again. Nostalgia and a love of setting retro images within modern settings or placed in a interstellar background are some of the common themes that immediately grab your attention. The music goes seamlessly with theimages and has a timeless feel to it, same as the art. The collages highlighted above are incredible in their own right but there work in one way or another has been used in the lofi culture</div>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study--body"><img src="../images/cs-5.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, (max-width: 590px) 88vw, 520px" srcset="../images/cs-5-p-500.png 500w, ../images/cs-5.png 520w" alt="" class="case-study--image">
      <div class="case-study--body--text">ART and music have always shared a symbiotic relationship. After going through tons of reddit threads of lofi artists discussing their work, it was observed that quite a few of these musicians are still in there teens and were visually inspired and wanted to make a beat that could go with what they saw, In some cases it was an anime sequence and in some other, a random illustration on pinterest, how artists get that initial idea that sets them of on a creative journey is always going to be an elusive concept to completely grasp, but we noticed that a lot of lofi musicians started off with an image in their head, or maybe saw something that caught their eye and sort of created a soundtrack that goes with the images and carries the same ethos. So lofi art has gone from being inspired by lofi hip hop to inspiring musicians to make new more organic nostalgic beats.</div>
